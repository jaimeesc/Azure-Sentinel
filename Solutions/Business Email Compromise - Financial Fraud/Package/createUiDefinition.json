This solution, in combination with other solutions listed below, provide a range of content to help detect and investigate BEC attacks at different stages of the attack cycle, and across multiple data sources including AWS, SAP, Okta, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365 and network logs.\n\nThis content covers all stages of the attack chain from an initial phishing attack vector, establishing persistence to an environment, locating and collecting sensitive financial information from data stores, and then perpetrating and hiding their fraud. This range of content complements the coverage [Microsoft 365 Defender provides across Microsoft Defender products](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/automatic-attack-disruption).\n\nIn order to gain the most comprehensive coverage possible customers should deploy the content included in this solution as well as content from the following solutions:<ul>\n\n<li> Azure Active Directory solution for Microsoft Sentinel\n\n</li><li>Microsoft 365 solution for Microsoft Sentinel\n\n</li><li>Amazon Web Services\n\n</li><li>Microsoft 365 Defender\n\n</li><li>Okta Single Sign On\n\n</li></ul>\n\n**Analytic Rules:** 7, **Hunting Queries:** 13\n\n[Learn more about Microsoft Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
